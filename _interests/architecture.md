**Aesthetics** as my favourite area of classical philosophy pulls me towards admiring uniquely designed and expertly brought-into-reality buildings and interiors – from a 21 story glass skyscraper to a hipster local café with artworks on a brick wall and designer wooden handmade chairs. Among the fields of my strong interests belong also **autonomous** cars, planes, computer doctors on blockchain-based healthcare sysems.. Today, these systems of digital computers have a long road ahead to reach reach the actual autonomy, despite the many short-term-gain-oriented tech firms that describe their devices as "autonomous". The fundamental philosophical concepts of autonomy were defined by masterminds like Kant and Aristotle centuries millenia ago, and yet they will, if implemented as a counetbalance to the fast-paced development of technology, play a crucial role in how man and machine coexist in 100 or 500 years from now. I intend to step into the enviroment of such devices & systems and contribute to its shaping using philosophy as my base stone.

title: Business

I see business as a medium through which I aim to **give back** to both my local Slovenian community and global enviroment. You can't change the world with good intentions only â€“ you need proper action, and such action is possible only by mastering the mechanism on which our current global society operates: **money**. I am actively involved in project organization and avidly study ways to progress at how I lead my teams, communicate with the people I interract with and unconditionally strive for excellence in both planning and execution of my projects.

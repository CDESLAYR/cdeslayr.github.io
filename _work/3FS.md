title: 3FS
job: Intern -
duration: Jun 2018 - Sep 2018
description: "The internship project I was assigned to conquer was to create a timetable web application to run on a Raspberry Pi that tracks a specific conference room's availability and schedule of the current day by accessing the Google Calendars API. Having a exceptional mentor, the CTO, who encouraged me to be autonomous by figuring out the things I didn't understand on my own, as well as being a team player and a morning-coffee-communicator made me adopt his such non code-related skills as well. Through the stimulating 3FS working enviroment and excellent guidance by my mentor I picked up languages like Golang, HTML, JavaScript, frameworks and tools like MongoDB, Express.js, Cheerio.js, Bootstrap, coding prerequisites such as using Git and terminal, and development & deployment practices like unit testing, using SSH, Docker and Heroku."

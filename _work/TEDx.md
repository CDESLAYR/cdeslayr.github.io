description: '"Ideas are the beginning points of all fortunes", as said by Napoleon Hill, is a statement I strongly agree with. That is exactly why I am part of the TEDx team that organizes conference at my high school, Gimnazija Kranj. Meeting successful speakers and helping them reherse to deliver their ideas in unique, thought-provoking ways that inspire the audience to develop ideas of their own gives me the ability to change my development enviroment, that is, my local community, for the better.'
